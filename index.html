          <p>Born in the corn jungles of Illinois, Matt was surrounded by vegetables and subpar sports teams from
            day
            1. The lack of success that surrounded him was frustrating. Matt was a "winner", and knew he had to get
            out.
          </p>
          <p>The next logical step for Matt was to move to a different city - one with a winning attitude. Matt
            pulled a "Lebron" by leaving a city devoid of opportunity and relocated to Boston. 3 World Series, 5
            Super Bowls, 1 NBA Championship, and 1 Stanley Cup later, Matt is still in New England, basking in the
            "winning glory".
          </p>
          <p>Matt has mimiced the winning ways of New England, and applied them to his career. "Do Your Job" and
            "No
            Days Off" are tattooed on his forehead, impressing potential employers.
          </p>
          <p>Now the Digital Marketing Strategist at an Ad Agency, Matt makes a living behind a computer.
            (Thankfully... Clients don't take kindly to permanent facial ink on someone who's taking their money)
            He
            currently develops and manages annoying online advertisements, and couldn't be happier.
          </p>
          <p>On his free time, when he has some, Matt is the top dog on his Slow Pitch Softball team. He excels at
            hitting dingers and arguing balls and strikes.
